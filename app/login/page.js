                <b>Welcome to the official Events Page of Vidyalankar Institute of
                Technology!</b>
                <br />
                This platform is built to streamline the entire event management
                experience within the institute. Our goal is to create a clean and
                efficient <b>Event Flow System</b> that not only informs but also
                simplifies how events are proposed, reviewed, and approved.
                <br />
                Through this system, students or coordinators can initiate an
                event proposal by filling out a structured digital form that
                includes event details, budget (if applicable), department, venue
                requirements, and other relevant information.
                <br />
                Once submitted, the proposal is automatically routed to the
                appropriate authorities in a <b>Hierarchical approval
                chain</b>â€”starting with the <b>Head of Department (HOD)</b>, and finally reaching the <b>Principal or Accounts Department</b> (if budget is involved).
                Each stage allows for transparent acceptance or rejection with
                remarks, ensuring full accountability.
                <br />
                This structured digital flow guarantees that events are reviewed
                efficiently, reducing manual delays and miscommunication. It
                ensures that only well-vetted events take place, fostering
                professionalism and smoother campus operations. 
                <br/>
                Stay tuned and be a part of the vibrant VIT community!
